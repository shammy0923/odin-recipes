        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>First, beat the eggs. Place them in a medium bowl, and whisk until the yolk and whites are thoroughly combined.</li>
            <li>Next, gently preheat the pan. Brush a small nonstick skillet with olive oil, or melt a little butter inside it. Warm the skillet over medium heat.</li>
            <li>Finally, cook. Pour in the egg mixture, and let it cook for a few seconds, undisturbed. Then, pull a rubber spatula across the bottom of the pan to form large, soft curds of scrambled eggs.</li>
