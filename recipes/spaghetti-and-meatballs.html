        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Begin with the meatballs: In a large bowl, combine the egg, basil, parsley, oregano, salt, pepper, garlic and water; whisk well.</li>
            <li>Add the meat, breadcrumbs and Parmigiano Reggiano. meatball recipe</li>
            <li>Roll the mixture into golf ball-sized meatballs, and place on an ungreased baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Bake for about 10 minutes, then remove the baking sheet from the oven and use a metal spatula or tongs to turn the meatballs (they will stick a bit but should release easily when you scrape under them with the spatula).</li>
            <li>Put the meatballs back in the oven and cook for another 10 minutes, until they are nicely browned and almost cooked through.</li>
            <li>In the meantime, bring the marinara sauce to a simmer in a large skillet. Taste it and adjust the seasoning if necessary (I usually add a healthy pinch of sugar and some freshly ground black pepper). Transfer the browned meatballs to the marinara sauce, leaving the fat behind. Cover loosely with a lid or foil and simmer for about 10 minutes, until the flavors marry and the meatballs are cooked through. Keep warm until ready to toss with pasta.</li>
            <li>While the meatballs are cooking, bring a large pot of well-salted water to a boil.</li>
            <li>Add the spaghetti and cook until al dente. Drain, then toss with the sauce and meatballs.</li>
        </ol>
